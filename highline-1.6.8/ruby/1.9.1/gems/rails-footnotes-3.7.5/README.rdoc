= Rails Footnotes

If you are developing in Rails you should know the plugin! It displays
footnotes in your application for easy debugging, such as sessions,
request parameters, cookies, filter chain, routes, queries, etc.

Even more, it contains links to open files directly in your editor including
your backtrace lines.

== Installation

NOTE: Since this branch aims Rails 3 support, if you want to use it with Rails 2.3 you should check this branch:

    https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes/tree/rails2

Install Rails Footnotes is very easy.

=== Rails 3.x

   gem 'rails-footnotes', '>= 3.7.5.rc4', :group => :development

After you install RailsFootnotes and add it to your Gemfile, you need to run the generator:

  rails generate rails_footnotes:install

=== Rails 2.x

In RAILS_ROOT/config/environments/development.rb (yes, you want it only in development):

  gem "rails-footnotes", '< 3.7.0', :group => :development

== Configuration

For version greater then 3.7.0

If you want to add alternate logic to enable or disable footnotes,
add something like this to config/initializers/footnotes.rb:

  if defined?(Footnotes) && Rails.env.development?
    Footnotes.run! # first of all

    # ... other init code
  end

=== Post initialization

If you want to add alternate logic to config footnotes without commit it to SCM, add your code to .footnotes:

    Footnotes::Filter.notes = []

this code temporarily disables notes for all controllers

=== Hooks

    Footnotes.setup do |config|
      config.before {|controller, filter| filter.notes = controller.class.name =~ /Message/ && \
        controller.action_name == 'index' ? [:assigns] : []}
      config.before {|controller, filter| filter.notes |= [:params] if controller.class.name =~ /Profile/ && \
        controller.action_name == 'edit' }
    end

If you are not using Textmate as text editor, in your environment.rb or
in an initializer do:

    Footnotes::Filter.prefix = 'mvim://open?url=file://%s&line=%d&column=%d'

for MacVim

Where you are going to choose a prefix compatible with your text editor. The %s is
replaced by the name of the file, the first %d is replaced by the line number and
the second %d is replaced by the column.

By default, footnotes are appended at the end of the page with default stylesheet. If you want
to change their position, you can define a div with id "footnotes_holder" or define your own stylesheet
by turning footnotes stylesheet off:

    Footnotes::Filter.no_style = true

Another option is to allow multiple notes to be opened at the same time:

    Footnotes::Filter.multiple_notes = true

Finally, you can control which notes you want to show. The default are:

    Footnotes::Filter.notes = [:session, :cookies, :params, :filters, :routes, :env, :queries, :log, :general]

== Creating your own notes

Create your notes to integrate with Footnotes is easy.

1. Create a Footnotes::Notes::YourExampleNote class
2. Implement the necessary methods (check abstract_note.rb file in lib/notes)
3. Append your example note in Footnotes::Filter.notes array (usually at the end of your environment file or in an initializer):

For example, to create a note that shows info about the user logged in your application you just have to do:

  module Footnotes
    module Notes
      class CurrentUserNote < AbstractNote
        # This method always receives a controller
        #
        def initialize(controller)
          @current_user = controller.instance_variable_get("@current_user")
        end

        # Returns the title that represents this note.
        #
        def title
          "Current user: #{@current_user.name}"
        end

        # This Note is only valid if we actually found an user
        # If it's not valid, it won't be displayed
        #
        def valid?
          @current_user
        end

        # The fieldset content
        #
        def content
          escape(@current_user.inspect)
        end
      end
    end
  end

Then put in your environment:

  Footnotes::Filter.notes += [:current_user]

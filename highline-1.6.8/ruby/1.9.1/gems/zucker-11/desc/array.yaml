array:
  summary: Methods one could miss for ⇧Array⇧.
  why:
  - ⇧Array⇧ has ⇧&⇧ and ⇧|⇧, but why does it not have ⇧^⇧?
  - ⇧sum⇧ is just needed pretty often..
  methods:
    Array#^: "[1,2,3,4] ^ [3,4,5,6]  # => [1,2,5,6]"
    Array#sum: "[1,2,3,4,5].sum  # => 15"
    Array#chrs: "[72, 97, 108, 108, 111].chrs  # => 'Hallo'"

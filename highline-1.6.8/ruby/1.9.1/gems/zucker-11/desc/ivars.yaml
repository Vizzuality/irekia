ivars:
  summary: This method lets you easily assign lots of instance variables.
  why: |
   Often, you have to write boilerplate code for assigning instance variables, for example this one:
   ⇧def initialize(variable1, variable2)
     @variable1, @variable2 = variable1, variable2
   end⇧
  methods:
    instance_variables_from, ivars: |
      def a_method(a = 1, b = 2)
        instance_variables_from binding # assigns @a and @b

        params = {:c => 3, :d => 4}
        instance_variables_from params # # assigns @c and @d
      end

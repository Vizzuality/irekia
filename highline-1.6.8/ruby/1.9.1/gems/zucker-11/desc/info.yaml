  summary: Access environment information with the ⇧Info⇧ module.
  why: "You don't need to remember in which global variable, constant or special method the information you are searching for is hidden."
  methods:
    Info: |
      # for example
      Info.working_directory # Dir.pwd
      Info.load_path         # $:
      Info.platform          # RUBY_PLATFORM
      Info.current_file      # similar to __FILE__
      # you could also add them to the global namespace with: include Info
      # see the source file for the list of accessors or
      Info.list
  info:
  - Please note that it is not possible to put some of __THOSE_KEYWORDS__ in methods, so the result might slightly differ. This might affect ⇧current_file⇧, ⇧current_file_directory⇧, ⇧current_line⇧ and ⇧current_method⇧.
  - Thanks to Facets for the ⇧caller⇧ Regexp.

alias_for:
  summary: 'A different way to create aliases: Reversed order and you can pass multiple alias names.'
  why: "It's clearer in which order to put the arguments."
  methods:
    alias_for, aliases_for: |
      alias_for :methods, :ms # creates an alias for the method :methods with the name ms
      module Enumerable
        aliases_for :zip, :with, :%
      end # creates multiple aliases
    Module#method_alias_for, Module#method_aliases_for: |
      # same as alias_for, but using Module#alias_method instead of alias
  info: 
  - Thanks to Kristian Mandrup for the idea and alias method specs.

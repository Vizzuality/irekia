os:
  summary: Detect the operating system.
  why: Checking for ⇧RUBY_PLATFORM⇧ does not report the OS when using JRuby and for better readability.
  methods:
    OS: "# displays the operating system"
    OS.linux?: "OS.linux? # true if you are on a linux machine"
    OS.mac?: "OS.mac? # true for macs"
    OS.bsd?: "OS.bsd? # true for bsds"
    OS.windows?: "include OS; windows? # true for windows. Example of including OS to get the os methods into the global namespace"
    OS.solaris?: "OS.solaris? # true for solaris/sunos"
    OS.posix?: "OS.posix? # true if system is posix compatible"
    OS.is?: "OS.is? /x/ # matches the regex against the os string"

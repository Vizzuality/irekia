module Boson
  # A library is a group of commands (Command objects) usually grouped together by a module.
  # Libraries are loaded from different sources depending on the library subclass. Default library
  # subclasses are FileLibrary, GemLibrary, RequireLibrary, ModuleLibrary and LocalFileLibrary.
  # See Loader for callbacks a library's module can have.
  #
  # == Naming a Library Module
  # Although you can name a library module almost anything, here's the fine print:
  # * A module can have any name if it's the only module in a library.
  # * If there are multiple modules in a file library, the module's name must be a camelized version
  #   of the file's basename i.e. ~/.boson/commands/ruby_core.rb -> RubyCore.
  # * Although modules are evaluated under the Boson::Commands namespace, Boson will warn you about creating
  #   modules whose name is the same as a top level class/module. The warning is to encourage users to stay
  #   away from error-prone libraries. Once you introduce such a module, _all_ libraries assume the nested module
  #   over the top level module and the top level module has to be prefixed with '::' _everywhere_.
  #
  # == Configuration
  # Libraries and their commands can be configured in different ways in this order:
  # * If library is a FileLibrary, commands be configured with a config method attribute (see Inspector).
  # * If a library has a module, you can set library + command attributes via the config() callback (see Loader).
  # * All libraries can be configured by passing a hash of {library attributes}[link:classes/Boson/Library.html#M000077] under
  #   {the :libraries key}[link:classes/Boson/Repo.html#M000070] to the main config file ~/.boson/config/boson.yml.
  #   For most libraries this may be the only way to configure a library's commands.
  #   An example of a GemLibrary config:
  #    :libraries:
  #      httparty:
  #       :class_commands:
  #         delete: HTTParty.delete
  #       :commands:
  #         delete:
  #           :alias: d
  #           :desc: Http delete a given url
  #
  # When installing a third-party library, use the config file as a way to override default library and command attributes
  # without modifying the library.
  #
  # === Creating Your Own Library
  # To create your own subclass you need to define what sources the subclass can handle with handles().
  # If handles() returns true then the subclass is chosen to load. See Loader to see what instance methods
  # to override for a subclass.
  class Library
    include Loader
    class <<self
      #:stopdoc:
      attr_accessor :handle_blocks

        (Library.handle_blocks ||= []) << [self,block]

    # Public attributes for use outside of Boson.
    ATTRIBUTES = [:gems, :dependencies, :commands, :loaded, :module, :name, :namespace, :indexed_namespace]
    attr_reader *(ATTRIBUTES + [:commands_hash, :library_file, :object_namespace])
    # Private attribute for use within Boson.
    attr_reader :no_alias_creation, :new_module, :new_commands, :class_commands, :lib_file, :repo_dir
    # Optional namespace name for a library. When enabled defaults to a library's name.
    attr_writer :namespace

    # Creates a library object with a hash of attributes which must include a :name attribute.
    # Each hash pair maps directly to an instance variable and value. Defaults for attributes
    # are read from config[:libraries][@library_name][@attribute]. When loading libraries, attributes
    # can also be set via a library module's config() method (see Loader).
    #
    # Attributes that can be configured:
    # [*:dependencies*] An array of libraries that this library depends on. A library won't load
    #                   unless its dependencies are loaded first.
    # [*:commands*] A hash or array of commands that belong to this library. A hash configures command attributes
    #               for the given commands with command names pointing to their configs. See Command.new for a
    #               command's configurable attributes. If an array, the commands are set for the given library,
    #               overidding default command detection. Example:
    #                :commands=>{'commands'=>{:desc=>'Lists commands', :alias=>'com'}}
    # [*:class_commands*] A hash of commands to create. A hash key-pair can map command names to any string of ruby code
    #                     that ends with a method call. Or a key-pair can map a class to an array of its class methods
    #                     to create commands of the same name. Example:
    #                      :class_commands=>{'spy'=>'Bond.spy', 'create'=>'Alias.manager.create',
    #                       'Boson::Util'=>['detect', 'any_const_get']}
    # [*:force*] Boolean which forces a library to ignore when a library's methods are overriding existing ones.
    #            Use with caution. Default is false.
    # [*:object_methods*] Boolean which detects any Object/Kernel methods created when loading a library and automatically
    #                     adds them to a library's commands. Default is true.
    # [*:namespace*] Boolean or string which namespaces a library. When true, the library is automatically namespaced
    #                to the library's name. When a string, the library is namespaced to the string. Default is nil.
    #                To control the namespacing of all libraries see Boson::Repo.config.
    # [*:no_alias_creation*] Boolean which doesn't create aliases for a library. Useful for libraries that configure command
    #                        aliases outside of Boson's control. Default is false.

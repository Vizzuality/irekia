unary:
  summary: Easy conversion between strings and symbols.
  why: "Sometimes, you do not care if you get a ⇧String⇧ or ⇧Symbol⇧ as input - but when analysing it, you often need to choose one format. A concise possibility for this conversion is using the unary operators ⇧String#-@⇧ and ⇧Symbol#+@⇧."
  methods:
    String#+@: "+'was_string' # => 'was_string'"
    String#-@: "-'was_string' # => :was_string"
    Symbol#+@: "+:was_symbol  # => 'was_symbol'"
    Symbol#-@: "-:was_symbol  # => :was_symbol"
  package: default
  info:
  - "Inspired by (I've seen the unary + for Symbol somewhere on the net... but cannot remember where...)"
  versions:
  - 1.9
  - 1.8 (⇧+:literal⇧ not possible)
